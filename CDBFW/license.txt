This  Program  is  distributed as ShareWare: you are granted the
right to evaluate the program for a maximum of  30  days  before
paying the author. After the evaluation period, you are required
to register or stop using the Program.

You are encouraged to distribute  the  original  and  unmodified
package  freely, in  any  form and on any media, provided you do
not charge any fee for the Program itself.

The Program could be included in CDROM collections, subscription
download  areas,  BBS  packages,  provided  it  remains  in  its
complete and unmodified original archive.

In  any  case, the  user must register with the author after the
evaluation period.

The inclusion of the Program as part of a software package to be
